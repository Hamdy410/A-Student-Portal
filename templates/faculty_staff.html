  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <p>
    Hello and welcome. This is the <strong>Faculty Staff</strong> page, where
    you can communicate with your <strong>Students</strong> &
    <strong>Admins</strong>. From here, you can regulate your courses, see the
    Media (Posts and Replies) and receive alerts from the users of higher
    authorities – in your case: Admins – through the site
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next few lines, We will introduce you to the main tasks and rules of
    becoming a faculty staff in our systems.
  </p>
  <h3>1) Courses:</h3>
  <p>
    From here, you can have the opportunity to regulate your current assigned
    courses, and the course enrollments regarding your course. You are shown the
    number of students who have requested to enroll in your course, but since
    the final list of students is given by the
    <strong>University administration</strong>, you cannot see the names of
    students who have enrolled in your specific courses.
  </p>
  <h3>2) Media:</h3>
  <p>
    As for the presence of our social service where you can share your posts and
    see communication and replies of other users regarding your posts.
    Currently, the system supports written text, and of course your favorite
    emojis are also supported.
  </p>
  <p>
    There you will find an environment of support, so feel free to ask all your
    questions here and we are here to answer you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >[Note: Any act of misconduct might resolve in completely deleting your
      post and/or your suspension from the system either temporarily or
      permanently. In that case, please head to the Students' Affairs
      Office.</strong

  </p>
  <h3>3) Alerts:</h3>
  <p>
    Your mission is to secure bot the systems and the web content. That means
    you must periodically monitor this section and the number of active alerts
    from admins.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>Alerts</strong>, you have the ability to send alerts only to
    students.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>Rules:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>1) Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Faculty Staff should only
    have access they need to perform their duties. This reduces the risk of
    accidental changes or security breaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2) Security Practices:</strong> Faculty Staff should follow secure
    practices, like using strong, unique passwords, and not sharing their
    credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3) Regular Updates:</strong> Keep the system updated to be protected
    against possible vulnerabilities. It's crucial to report any possible
    breaches, glitches or malfunctions as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>4) Training:</strong> All faculty staff are ensured to be properly
    trained and understand their responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5) Incident Response:</strong> Have a plan for responding to
    security incidents, and make sure all faculty staff are familiar with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6) Compliance:</strong> Ensure all actions are in compliance with
    relevant laws and regulations.
